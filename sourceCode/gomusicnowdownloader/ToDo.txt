GoMusicNow Downloader ToDo List
===============================

Next
	* Completion message on the installer

Short Term
	* Incorporate each file's download progress into the overall progress, for finer grained progres reporting. (it would need to assume all downloads are equally sized)
	* Need to add unit tests. This will involve mocking out the http access. This will no dount involve major code change
	* Can files be viewed in the select folder dialog? It would be useful to see if folder is empty
	* Could probably use the eventArgs.fileNumber instead of class variable fileNumber

Refactoring
	* Change downloader class to a singleton instance class instead of static. Allows use of constructor instead of Reset() function
	* Possibly other events such as RequestingLogin, LoginSuccessful, LoginFailed, TrackListRecieved (check naming recommendations)
	* Use these custom events internally in the Downloader class

Longer term
	* Globalisation?
	* Allow adding several pairs of 'links' and 'local folders' to a queue
	* Change the progress bar to a grid showing (perhaps) some ID3 info, the destination folder, and progress
	* Move the settings into a separate dialog (prob only useful if I decide to add a web browser control)


Decided Against:
	User supplies only a root folder for all music. The app then reads ID3 tags to determine the folder structure to put the links into
Rationale:
	Most users will give a different folder structure to Compilations, Soundtracks, than for albums with a single artist. 
	Also, I'm not convinced the Artist and Album Artist fields are used consistently for all downloads in the GoMusicNow website'''
